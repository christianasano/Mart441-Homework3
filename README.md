# Mart441-Homework3
The challenges I faced with this assignment was trying to stay organized on each click of the button. Whenever I wanted to change the story, I had to make sure in the javascript matched up to the code name I gave it. It was really easy because its just a step and repeat proccess. Howver I struggled to get that code understanded, basically the step by step.
I was able to figure out hoe to connect the buttons nad I made sure each story was a inspiration. Or made you laugh at what the buttons would say. The point is I love how custom I was able to make the interactivity on this HW. I wish I could customize Each type and font everytime you click the buttons. I wish to to do that next on my piece.
